# ### In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# *Objectives:*
# * Types of ML are Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement.
# * Supervised learning comprises two types of models, regression and classification.
# * Deep learning refers to a general set of models and techniques that loosely emulate the way the human brain solves a wide range of problems.
# * Community Data License Agreement makes it easier to share open data.
# * Curiosity is the key for Data Science 
# 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. SQL 
# 3. R 

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# * Numpy
# * Pandas
# * ApacheSpark
# * Scala
# * Scikit-Learn
# * Matplotlib

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# * 1 + 1 = 2 
# * 2 - 1 = 1 
# * 3 * 3 = 9 
# * 10 // 2 = 5

# In[2]:


# cell to multiple 
x = (3*4)+5
print(x)

# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers


# In[3]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

min = 200
h = min/60
print(h)
